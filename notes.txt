In order to make the file dialog work in a virtualenv, be sure to copy the "tcl" folder from C://Python## and paste it in the root of the virtualenv. 

Make sure the audio files are named properly before running the script. The name of an audio file will drive the filename of the html document. 

Audio filenames should take the form "songx_[variation level](_[variation type, if any]y).mp3" where [variation level] is replaced with "low", "mod", or "high", 
and where [variation type, if any] is replaced by a variation type descriptor (e.g. 'mel' for 'melodic' variation) if applicable. When no variation type (e.g. 'melodic') is specified,
"remix" variation is assumed. x denotes the song number; this can be determined by checking "SongNumbersandIdentities.txt". y denotes the variation number; in the case of
multiple variations of the same song and level, this number is used to differentiate between them.

example 'good' audio filenames:
song5_low_mel_2.mp3  (the 2nd low melodic variation of song #5)
song2_high.mp3		(the high variation of song #2)
song14_mod_4.mp3	(the fourth moderate variation of song #14)

Song number (e.g. 'song4', 'song156') and variation level (e.g. 'low', 'mod') must be included. Variation type (e.g. 'mel', 'fullsong') and variation number (e.g. '2', '24') are optional. 

Make sure the filename contains no '.', no '/'. Windows already checks for the '/'.
	
Be sure to update SongNumbersandIdentities.txt upon the addition of an entirely new song. 

The .mp3 file name will be used to name the html file, so adherence to the above naming convention is very helpful for organization.
